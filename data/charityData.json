The idea of giving something to one person by paying another was applied by Benjamin Franklin as a \"trick [...] for doing a deal of good with a little money\", which came to be known as \"pay it forward.\" This form of giving is often used as an alternative to consumerism and to mitigate the impact of gift-giving on the environment.\nCharities that promote this type of donating will normally provide a card or certificate describing the donation, often with an example of how the donation will be used (such as one day\u2019s worth of food for a hungry person) or a symbolic denomination, called \"ownership\" or \"adoption\" (of an animal or a tree for example). Some charities promote alternative giving at weddings in place of wedding favors, normally providing several cards to be left on tables at the reception letting guests know a donation has been made rather than individual cards for each guest. Kate Middleton and Prince William made the decision to \"Pay it Forward\" with their wedding gifts, asking that the money to be used for gifts be given to charities and good causes.",

        "mission": "Altruism or selflessness is the principle or practice of concern for the welfare of others. It is a traditional virtue in many cultures and a core aspect of various religious traditions and secular worldviews, though the concept of \"others\" toward whom concern should be directed can vary among cultures and religions. Altruism or selflessness is the opposite of selfishness. The word was coined by the French philosopher Auguste Comte in French, as altruisme, for an antonym of egoism. He derived it from the Italian altrui, which in turn was derived from Latin alteri, meaning \"other people\" or \"somebody else\".\nAltruism in biological organisms can be defined as an individual performing an action which is at a cost to themselves (e.g., pleasure and quality of life, time, probability of survival or reproduction), but benefits, either directly or indirectly, another third-party individual, without the expectation of reciprocity or compensation for that action. Steinberg suggests a definition for altruism in the clinical setting, that is \"intentional and voluntary actions that aim to enhance the welfare of another person in the absence of any quid pro quo external rewards\".\nAltruism can be distinguished from feelings of loyalty, in that whilst the latter is predicated upon social relationships, altruism does not consider relationships. Much debate exists as to whether \"true\" altruism is possible in human psychology. The theory of psychological egoism suggests that no act of sharing, helping or sacrificing can be described as truly altruistic, as the actor may receive an intrinsic reward in the form of personal gratification. The validity of this argument depends on whether intrinsic rewards qualify as \"benefits\". The actor also may not be expecting a reward.\nThe term altruism may also refer to an ethical doctrine that claims that individuals are morally obliged to benefit others. Used in this sense, it is usually contrasted with egoism, which is defined as acting to the benefit of one's self.",

The Atlantic Philanthropies focuses its giving on health, social, and politically liberal public policy causes in Australia, Bermuda, Ireland, South Africa, the United States and Vietnam. It is among the largest foreign charitable donors in each of the countries in which it operates, and is the single largest funder of programs that encourage the civic engagement of older people and of comprehensive immigration reform in the United States. With the single largest advocacy grant ever made by a foundation, the Atlantic Philanthropies committed $27 million to win passage of the Affordable Care Act in the United States. About half of the Atlantic Philanthropies' grants have been made in donations that allow lobbying.\nSince its founding in 1982, the Atlantic Philanthropies has given out about $7.5 billion. The Atlantic Philanthropies is a limited-life foundation which will close its doors in 2020. The President and CEO of the Atlantic Philanthropies is Christopher Oechsli. He was appointed in 2011, succeeding Gara LaMarche. Martin O'Brien was appointed Senior Vice President of Programmes shortly thereafter.\nOne tactic used by the Atlantic Philanthropies is to use the promise of substantial gifts to compel governments and other donors to match. A total of $226 million in Atlantic grants have leveraged $1.3 billion of government money to the Irish university system. Atlantic's most recent grantmaking statistics are from 2014. The Atlantic Philanthropies commenced a spend-down process in 2012, and its entire portfolio will be liquid by the end of 2016. It plans to fully shutter its doors in 2020.\n\n",

Also present in New Zealand.\nOn the last Friday of October, CanTeen hold National Bandanna Day (NBD) where Bandannas are sold to fundraise. National Bandanna Day is CanTeen\u2019s largest fundraiser and this year (2016) it will be held on Friday 28 October. They're aiming to raise $1.25 million to support young people living with cancer. Every year, another 23,000 young people (63 a day) have to deal with the challenge of cancer. Bandannas play a significant role as a symbol of hope and empowerment for people who are affected by cancer and are worn during their cancer journey.\nCanTeen helps young people cope with cancer in their family. Through CanTeen, they learn to explore and deal with their feelings about cancer, connect with other young people in the same boat and if they\u2019ve been diagnosed themselves, CanTeen also provides specialist, youth-specific treatment teams. By feeling understood and supported, young people develop resilience and can rebuild the foundations that crumbled beneath them when cancer turned their life upside down. CanTeen works by having young people at the centre of everything they do. They were set up by a group of young cancer patients in 1985 and still have young people affected by cancer guiding the organisation at every level.\nCombined with their leading edge research into the emotional and social impacts of cancer, it ensures that they truly understand how cancer is different in a young person\u2019s world.\nPeer support\nThrough CanTeen, young people affected by cancer can meet and be supported by others their age who truly understand what they\u2019re going through. They can share experiences through the online community or attend CanTeen Camps or Recreation Days, where they can make new friends, develop coping skills and have a lot of fun too.\nCounselling\nCanTeen\u2019s specially trained counsellors give young people a safe space to talk about difficult thoughts and feelings and help them develop coping strategies. Sadness, anxiety and grief don\u2019t stick to business hours so neither do CanTeen. Online and phone counselling is available seven days a week. Or you can also meet a counsellor face to face.\nInformation and advice\nCanTeen has information and advice about the challenges young people face, from how to talk to friends about cancer to what all the medical jargon means. They can find answers at canteen.org.au where they can also download or order books tailored to their specific cancer experience.\nYouth Cancer Services\nFunded by CanTeen as well as Federal, State and Territory health departments, the Youth Cancer Services provide specialist, age-appropriate medical treatment and psychological support for young people with cancer.\nOnline support\nCanTeen provides world-leading online support for young people living with cancer. At canteen.org.au, they have 24/7 access to a secure online community just for young people like them and can chat to a counsellor using instant messaging or email.\nLeadership development\nCanTeen is passionate about empowerment and is proud to have young people providing direction and advice at all levels of the organisation, including the Board of Directors. Being a Member-led organisation ensures that every aspect of CanTeen\u2019s work is informed by young people so that they get the services, programs and information right. Any young person that receives support from CanTeen can put themselves forward to participate in the organisation\u2019s governance structure. Each local CanTeen Division has a committee that meets regularly to oversee the planning of programs and activities within the Division. Young people hold the majority of positions on those committees. Each Division also elects one Member to sit on the Member Advisory Council and advise the Board.\nCanTeen\u2019s Board of Directors consists of five Member Directors and four Associate Directors, volunteers who bring relevant experience to the Board.

For the child abuse scandal, see Casa Pia child sexual abuse scandal.\n\nThe Casa Pia is a Portuguese institution founded by Maria I, known as A Pia (\"Mary the Pious\"), and organized by Police Intendant Pina Manique in 1780, following the social disarray of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake. For almost three centuries, thousands of young boys and girls were raised by Casa Pia, including many public personalities, called casapianos. Casa Pia is Portugal's largest educational institution dedicated to helping youngsters in risk of social exclusion or without parental support.\nThe organisation is composed of ten schools and enrolls approximately 4700 students. In addition to standard schooling, the organisation also provides boarding for children in need. It strives to enable these youngsters to become healthy and successful members of society, by developing intellectual, manual, and physical traits, in an environment promoting spiritual, moral, and religious values. The institution is proud to have had amongst its students many outstanding Portuguese personalities, including politicians, journalists, and artists.\nThe first location was in Castle of S\u00e3o Jorge of Lisbon, an important center of production for the Portuguese Royal Navy and Army, and also for vocational education: masters trained at Casa Pia, when returned to their home, instruct others in the same profession. More advanced alumns may advance to professional careers. Next level course studies at London (for medicine), the Portuguese Royal Navy academy, Rome, and the Portuguese Academy.\nTwo years after the death of Pina Manique, the Casa Pia closed due to the occupation of the Castle of S\u00e3o Jorge by the French troops of Junot. The school reopened in 1812 at Convento do Desterro, and then the government moved the institution to Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery, Lisbon at 1833. In 1942, it created a network of homes for children.

The acceptance of funds from wealthy donors has been a source of controversy. The foundation \"has won accolades from philanthropy experts and has drawn bipartisan support\".\nCharitable grants are not a major focus of the Clinton Foundation, which instead uses most of its money to carry out its own humanitarian programs.\nThis foundation is a public organization to which anyone may donate and is distinct from the Clinton Family Foundation, a private organization for personal Clinton family philanthropy.\nAccording to the Foundation's website, neither Bill Clinton nor his daughter, Chelsea Clinton (both are members of the governing board), draws any salary or receives any income from the Foundation.

Kome\u0144skiego, or Fundacja Kome\u0144skiego), is a children's welfare non-governmental organisation based in Warsaw, Poland, established in September 2003. The Foundation's goal is to provide equal educational opportunities to children aged 3\u20135 years, particularly in rural areas of high unemployment, in response to a dramatic decline in preschool education services in Poland. Only 38% of children aged 3\u20135 attended pre-school, which means that some 750,000 children in this age group is left out of pre-school care. In rural areas the attendance figure is below 10%. This is the lowest result in the whole European Union.\nThe Foundation organises and conducts training for teachers, school and kindergarten headmasters, teachers and local educational authorities.\nThe Foundation's \"Where There Are No Pre-schools\" programme aims at helping rural communities to develop new models for early-childhood education, based on local financial resources. A pilot scheme was set up in 28 rural communities, where 75 Early Childhood Education Centres have been set up, with over 800 children. Educational activities are provided by teachers trained by the Comenius Foundation to use the project approach in the classroom. The local authorities cover the costs of the teachers' salaries and the premises, whereas the Foundation is responsible for financing the teacher training, monitoring the quality of teaching and setting up local libraries. An external evaluation of the programme, commissioned by the Foundation, will enable modification while the programme is being implemented.",

        "mission": "Fundraising or fund raising (also known as \"development\") is the process of gathering voluntary contributions of money or other resources, by requesting donations from individuals, businesses, charitable foundations, or governmental agencies (see also crowd funding). Although fundraising typically refers to efforts to gather money for non-profit organizations, it is sometimes used to refer to the identification and solicitation of investors or other sources of capital for for-profit enterprises.\nTraditionally, fundraising consisted mostly of asking for donations on the street or at people's doors, and this is experiencing very strong growth  in the form of face-to-face fundraising, but new forms of fundraising, such as online fundraising, have emerged in recent years, though these are often based on older methods such as grassroots fundraising.",

The association aims at promoting the exchange of medical knowledge and biomedical technology between industry nations and countries with a low health standard, such as Mongolia, Panama, Bolivia and Yemen.\nInfectious diseases are worldwide a major cause of death, especially in developing countries. Next to inexpensive drugs, there is an urgent need for affordable diagnostic methods. Recent progress in biomedical research led to new techniques highly appropriate for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. These new methods are advantageous not only because they lead to results in short time, but also because they are affordable and applicable under conditions of poverty. Major objective of GEFEK is the transfer of this knowledge to scientists in low-income countries and to establish the new technology in a way that it can be performed without help from abroad. The transfer includes information on the theoretical background, the performance of molecular diagnostic methods and the knowledge for the production of the necessary test substances. The self-contained operation of this technology by the affected population is the best guarantee for their sustainable application.\nIn contrast to other organisations, which provide help directly in crisis regions, the contribution of GEFEK consists in the transfer of basic medical knowledge and technology, in order to help the people in poor countries according to the principle \"help to self-help\". A lot of health problems are not due in the first instance to a lack of medicines, but rather to the lack of appropriate methods for the diagnosis of the affecting diseases. Frequently, there are no adequate diagnostic methods available which could be used, or the available methods are inaffordable, this means, considerably more expensive than the needed drugs. GEFEK not only teaches physicians and technical personal but also the new scientific generation, i.e. students in medicine and other health-related disciplines.",

Kessler, also known as the \"Champagne King,\" was a passenger on the RMS Lusitania in 1915 when it was torpedoed by a German U-boat. When he was fighting for his life in the cold waters of the Atlantic off the coast of Ireland, he vowed that if he survived, he would devote much of his time and substantial financial resources to a worthwhile cause. The cause he chose was assisting Allied soldiers blinded in the service. He later befriended Helen Keller and helped found the organization that became Helen Keller International.\nHKI\u2019s two major areas of expertise are Eye Health and Nutrition. Its Eye Health programs address the major causes of blindness in the world, including cataract, trachoma and onchocerciasis, and treating refractive error. Its nutrition programs include vitamin A, iron/folate, and multi-micronutrient supplementation, fortification of commonly used foods, dietary diversification, community- and school-gardening as well as school health activities, the promotion of breastfeeding and complementary feeding, and nutritional surveillance to provide critical data to governments and other development partners. Each year, HKI's programs benefit millions of people.\nCurrently, HKI works in 22 countries around the world in Africa, Asia and the United States. Global headquarters are located in New York City, and programs are also developed and administered through regional offices, currently located in Senegal and Phnom Penh, as well as through 19 country offices and an additional development office in Paris.

ITI builds on growing international momentum to support the World Health Organization\u2019s goal of eliminating blinding trachoma as a public health concern by 2020. Working in countries where the WHO has documented widespread disease, ITI catalyzes partnerships among international agencies and governmental and non-governmental organizations. ITI supports national governments in their efforts to implement sustainable trachoma control programs using the WHO-recommended SAFE strategy, which includes:\nSurgery to correct advanced stages of the disease;\nAntibiotics to treat active infection, using Zithromax donated by Pfizer Inc;\nFacial cleanliness to reduce disease transmission;\nEnvironmental change to increase access to clean water and improved sanitation to eliminate disease altogether.\nSince launching its first programs in Morocco and Tanzania in 1999, ITI has steadily expanded trachoma control efforts to an additional 12 countries in Africa and Asia. In 2008, ITI will take on two additional country programs. This rapid expansion has been made possible by Pfizer\u2019s donation of the antibiotic Zithromax, the dedication of national governments, and the commitment of ITI\u2019s partners to support the F and E components of SAFE implementation. To date over 53 million antibiotic treatments have been administered, over 276,000 individuals have received sight-saving surgery, and millions of people in endemic countries have benefited from health education and improved access to water and sanitation.\nTrachoma is a highly infectious eye disease caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis, which can be spread through contact with an infected person. Untreated, repeated trachoma infections result in a painful form of permanent blindness when the eyelids turn inward, causing the eyelashes to scratch the cornea. Although children are the most susceptible to infection, the effects are often not felt until adulthood. Women, traditionally the caretakers of the home, are three times more likely than men to be blinded by the disease. Without intervention, trachoma keeps families shackled within a cycle of poverty, as the disease and its long-term effects are passed from one generation to the next.",

Unlike other international NGOs, IUCN does not itself aim to mobilize the public in support of nature conservation.

Some 11,000 scientists and experts participate in the work of IUCN commissions on a voluntary basis. It employs approximately 1000 full-time staff in more than 60 countries.

        "mission": "Invisible Children, Inc. is an organization founded in 2004 to increase awareness of the activities of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in Central Africa, and its leader, Joseph Kony. Specifically, the group seeks to put an end to the practices of the LRA which include abductions and abuse of children, and forcing them to serve as soldiers. To this end, Invisible Children urges the United States government to take military action in the central region of Africa. Invisible Children also operates as a charitable organization, soliciting donations and selling merchandise to raise money for its cause. The organization promotes its cause by dispensing films on the internet and presenting in high schools and colleges around the United States.\nWhen the organization was founded, the LRA was active in Uganda. The rebel group left Uganda in 2006 and continues to operate in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan. Invisible Children advocated for the passing of the Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act, a piece of legislation which led to the deployment of 100 combat-equipped, US soldiers to the region for the purpose of advising the local forces in tracking, and capturing, Joseph Kony. The United Nations Security Council met in November of that year to discuss the LRA. Internationally, journalists began to seek more information about the conditions in Central Africa at that time.\nThe group has received both praise and criticism for its methods. The organization's films have won several awards, while the group's use of funds, projection of facts, and support of the SPLA and the Ugandan Army have come into question as these two groups have been known to commit similar atrocities to those blamed on the LRA. In March 2012, Invisible Children began an internet video campaign called Kony 2012, the purpose being to promote the charity's 'Stop Kony' movement to make indicted Ugandan war criminal Joseph Kony internationally known in order to arrest him in 2012.",

However, as the field has grown, there are increasing numbers of free-standing graduate and undergraduate programs not bound within traditional disciplines.

It is distinct in U.S. law from public-benefit nonprofit corporations, and religious corporations. Mutual benefit corporations must still file tax returns and pay income tax because they are not formed for a purpose that is meant to benefit the general public (unlike public-benefit nonprofit corporations) but rather to provide an association of people with a common benefit. Due to its private purpose, a mutual benefit corporation pays the same taxes as a regular for-profit corporation (C corporation tax rates). However, the IRS still allows for tax exemptions for certain types of mutual-benefit nonprofits (501(c)(6)).\nMutual benefit corporations are formed for common gain purposes such as providing insurance for members (many insurance companies still have \"mutual\" in their names, though many have since adopted other corporate forms), establishing a community financial institution, managing common property, or promoting the social or economic welfare of member individuals or organizations (for example through trade groups, professional organizations or business districts). Some mutual water companies are organized as mutual benefit corporations; an electric membership corporation is another example.\nMutual benefit corporations have their roots in the benefit societies that sprang up to offer services and solidarity to workers during the Industrial Revolution, though most today do not have any particular connection to labor movements.",

In 2015, over 30,000 personnel \u2014 mostly local doctors, nurses and other medical professionals, logistical experts, water and sanitation engineers and administrators \u2014 provided medical aid in over 70 countries. The vast majority of staff are volunteers. Private donors provide about 90% of the organization's funding, while corporate donations provide the rest, giving MSF an annual budget of approximately US$750 million.\nM\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res was founded in 1971, in the aftermath of the Biafra secession, by a small group of French doctors and journalists who sought to expand accessibility to medical care across national boundaries and irrespective of race, religion, creed or political affiliation. To that end, the organisation emphasises \"independence and impartiality\", and explicitly precludes political, economic, or religious factors in its decision making. For these reasons, it limits the amount of funding received from governments or intergovernmental organisation. These principles have allowed MSF to speak freely with respect to acts of war, corruption, or other hindrances to medical care or human well-being. Only once in its history, during the 1994 genocide in Rwanda, has the organisation called for military intervention.\nMSF's principles and operational guidelines are highlighted in its Charter, the Chantilly Principles, and the later La Mancha Agreement. Governance is addressed in Section 2 of the Rules portion of this final document. MSF has an associative structure, where operational decisions are made, largely independently, by the five operational centres (Amsterdam, Barcelona-Athens, Brussels, Geneva and Paris). Common policies on core issues are coordinated by the International Council, in which each of the 24 sections (national offices) is represented. The International Council meets in Geneva, Switzerland, where the International Office, which coordinates international activities common to the operational centres, is also based.\nMSF has general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council. It received the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize in recognition of its members' continued efforts to provide medical care in acute crises, as well as raising international awareness of potential humanitarian disasters. James Orbinski, who was the president of the organization at the time, accepted the prize on behalf of MSF. Prior to this, MSF also received the 1996 Seoul Peace Prize. Joanne Liu has served as the international president since 1 October 2013.\nMSF should not be confused with M\u00e9decins du Monde (Doctors of the World), which was formed in part by members of the former organisation, but is an entirely independent non-governmental organisation with no links to MSF today.",

        "mission": "A non-governmental organization (NGO) is a not-for-profit organization that is independent from states and international governmental organizations. They are usually funded by donations but some avoid formal funding altogether and are run primarily by volunteers. NGOs are highly diverse groups of organizations engaged in a wide range of activities, and take different forms in different parts of the world. Some may have charitable status, while others may be registered for tax exemption based on recognition of social purposes. Others may be fronts for political, religious, or other interests.\nThe number of NGOs worldwide is estimated to be 3.7 million. Russia has 277,000 NGOs. India is estimated to have had around 2 million NGOs in 2009, just over one NGO per 600 Indians, and many times the number of primary schools and primary health centres in India. China is estimated to have approximately 440,000 officially registered NGOs.\nNGOs are difficult to define, and the term 'NGO' is not always used consistently. In some countries the term NGO is applied to an organization that in another country would be called an NPO (nonprofit organization), and vice versa. There are many different classifications of NGO in use. The most common focus is on \"orientation\" and \"level of operation\". An NGO's orientation refers to the type of activities it takes on. These activities might include human rights, environmental, improving health, or development work. An NGO's level of operation indicates the scale at which an organization works, such as local, regional, national, or international.\nThe term \"non-governmental organization\" was first coined in 1945, when the United Nations (UN) was created. The UN, itself an intergovernmental organization, made it possible for certain approved specialized international non-state agencies \u2014 i.e., non-governmental organizations \u2014 to be awarded observer status at its assemblies and some of its meetings. Later the term became used more widely. Today, according to the UN, any kind of private organization that is independent from government control can be termed an \"NGO\", provided it is not-for-profit, nonprevention, but not simply an opposition political party.\nOne characteristic these diverse organizations share is that their non-profit status means they are not hindered by short-term financial objectives. Accordingly, they are able to devote themselves to issues which occur across longer time horizons, such as climate change, malaria prevention, or a global ban on landmines. Public surveys reveal that NGOs often enjoy a high degree of public trust, which can make them a useful \u2013 but not always sufficient \u2013 proxy for the concerns of society and stakeholders.",

        "mission": "A nonprofit organization (NPO) (also known as a non-business entity) is an organization whose purpose is something other than making a profit. A nonprofit organization is often dedicated to furthering a particular social cause or advocating for a particular point of view. In economic terms, a nonprofit organization uses its surplus revenues to further achieve its purpose or mission, rather than distributing its surplus income to the organization's shareholders (or equivalents) as profit or dividends. This is known as the non-distribution constraint. The decision to adopt a nonprofit legal structure is one that will often have taxation implications, particularly where the nonprofit seeks income tax exemption, charitable status and so on.\nThe terms nonprofit and not-for-profit are not consistently differentiated across jurisdictions. In layman's terms they are usually equivalent in concept, although in various jurisdictions there are accounting and legal differences.\nThe nonprofit landscape is highly varied, although many people have come to associate NPOs with charitable organizations. Although charities do make up an often high-profile or visible aspect of the sector, there are many other types of nonprofit organization. Overall, they tend to be either member-serving or community-serving. Member-serving organizations include mutual societies, cooperatives, trade unions, credit unions, industry associations, sports clubs, retired serviceman's clubs and advocacy groups or peak bodies \u2013 organizations that benefit a particular group of people, i.e. the members of the organization. Typically, community-serving organizations are focused on providing services to the community in general, either globally or locally: organizations delivering human services programs or projects, aid and development programs, medical research, education and health services, and so on. It could be argued many nonprofits sit across both camps, at least in terms of the impact they make. For example, the grassroots support group that provides a lifeline to those with a particular condition or disease could be deemed to be serving its members (by directly supporting them) and the broader community (through the provision of a service for fellow citizens).\nMany NPOs use the model of a double bottom line in that furthering their cause is more important than making a profit, though both are needed to ensure the organization's sustainability.\nAlthough NPOs are permitted to generate surplus revenues, they must be retained by the organization for its self-preservation, expansion, or plans. NPOs have controlling members or a board of directors. Many have paid staff including management, whereas others employ unpaid volunteers and executives who work with or without compensation (occasionally nominal). In some countries, where there is a token fee, in general, it is used to meet legal requirements for establishing a contract between the executive and the organization.\nDesignation as a nonprofit does not mean that the organization does not intend to make a profit, but rather that the organization has no 'owners' and that the funds realized in the operation of the organization will not be used to benefit any owners. The extent to which an NPO can generate surplus revenues may be constrained or use of surplus revenues may be restricted.",

In this meaning, it involves both the benefactor in their identifying and exercising their values, and the beneficiary in their receipt and benefit from the service or goods provided. A conventional modern definition is \"private initiatives, for the public good, focusing on quality of life,\" which combines an original humanistic tradition with a social scientific aspect developed in the 20th century. The definition also serves to contrast philanthropy with business endeavors, which are private initiatives for private good, e.g., focusing on material gain, and with government endeavors, which are public initiatives for public good, e.g., focusing on provision of public services. A person who practices philanthropy is called a philanthropist.\nPhilanthropy has distinguishing features from charity; not all charity is philanthropy, or vice versa, though there is a recognized degree of overlap in practice. A difference commonly cited is that charity aims to relieve the pain of a particular social problem, whereas philanthropy attempts to address the root cause of the problem\u2014the difference between the proverbial gift of a fish to a hungry person, versus teaching them how to fish.",

The organization began operations in January 2002.

According to the organization, it has financed the distribution of 659 million insecticide-treated nets to combat malaria, provided anti-tuberculosis treatment for 15,1 million people, and is supporting 9.2 million people on antiretroviral therapy for AIDS.\nThe Global Fund is a financing mechanism rather than an implementing agency. This means that monitoring of programs is supported by a Secretariat of approximately over 700 staff (as of end 2015) in Geneva. Implementation is overseen by Country Coordinating Mechanisms, committees consisting of in-country stakeholders that need to include, according to Global Fund requirements, a broad spectrum of government, NGOs, UN, faith-based, private sector and people living with the disease. This has kept the Global Fund Secretariat smaller than other international bureaucracies, yet it has also raised concerns about conflict of interest, as some of the stakeholders represented on the CCMs may also receive money from the Global Fund, either as Principal Recipients, Subrecipients, private persons (e.g. for travel or participation at seminars) or contractors.",

Today, tithes are normally voluntary and paid in cash, cheques, or stocks, whereas historically tithes were required and paid in kind, such as agricultural products. Several European countries operate a formal process linked to the tax system allowing some churches to assess tithes.\nTraditional Jewish law and practice has included various forms of tithing since ancient times. Orthodox Jews commonly practice ma'aser kesafim (tithing 10% of their income to charity). In modern Israel, Jews continue to follow the laws of agricultural tithing, e.g., ma'aser rishon, terumat ma'aser, and ma'aser sheni. In Christianity, some interpretations of Biblical teachings conclude that although tithing was practiced extensively in the Old Testament, it was never practiced or taught within the first-century Church. Instead, the New Testament scriptures are seen as teaching the concept of \"freewill offerings\" as a means of supporting the church: 1 Corinthians 16:2, 2 Corinthians 9:7. Also, some of the earliest groups sold everything they had and held the proceeds in common to be used for the furtherance of the Gospel: Acts 2:44-47, Acts 4:34-35. Further, Acts 5:1-20 contains the account of a man and wife (Ananias and Sapphira) who were living in one of these groups. They sold a piece of property and donated only part of the selling price to the church but claimed to have given the whole amount and immediately fell down and died when confronted by the apostle Peter over their dishonesty.\nTithes were mentioned at the Council of Tours in 567 and the Synod of M\u00e2con in 585.

It was founded by Tulsa oilman, banker, and philanthropist George Kaiser, who felt that Tulsa's historical dependence on unorganized private giving from its wealthy families was no longer effective. Beginning with gifts from seventeen local philanthropists, by 2006 Tulsa Community Foundation had grown to become the largest community foundation in the country, surpassing the New York Community Trust, and it remained the largest until 2013, when a $1 billion contribution lifted the Silicon Valley Community Foundation into first place. Kaiser's family foundation remains the largest contributor to the community foundation, which also manages about 600 donor advised funds.\nIn 2005, members of the United States Senate Committee on Finance, and others, criticized the foundation structure of TCF, and other charities, for arguably permitting givers to take tax deductions out of proportion to the actual amounts given for public charity, and for potentially allowing the donors to have effective control of the community foundation.

It is based on the Hebrew word (\u05e6\u05d3\u05e7, Tzedek) meaning righteousness, fairness or justice, and it is related to the Hebrew word Tzadik meaning righteous as an adjective (or righteous individual as a noun in the form of a substantive). In Judaism, tzedakah refers to the religious obligation to do what is right and just, which Judaism emphasises are important parts of living a spiritual life. Maimonides says that, while the second highest form of tzedakah is to give donations anonymously to unknown recipients, the highest form is to give a gift, loan, or partnership that will result in the recipient supporting himself instead of living upon others. Unlike philanthropy or charity, which is completely voluntary, tzedakah is seen as a religious obligation, which must be performed regardless of financial standing, and must even be performed by poor people. Tzedakah is considered to be one of the three main acts that can annul a less than favorable heavenly decree. The term is synonymous with Sadaqah or Saddka (Arabic: \u0635\u062f\u0642\u0629 ), an Islamic term meaning \"voluntary charity\".",

It is one of the members of the United Nations Development Group and its executive committee.\nUNICEF was created by the United Nations General Assembly on 11 December 1946, to provide emergency food and healthcare to children in countries that had been devastated by World War II. The Polish physician Ludwik Rajchman is widely regarded as the founder of UNICEF and served as its first chairman from 1946. On Rajchman's suggestion, the American Maurice Pate was appointed its first executive director, serving from 1947 until his death in 1965. In 1953, UNICEF's mandate was extended to address the needs of children in the developing world and became a permanent part of the United Nations System. At that time, the words \"international\" and \"emergency\" were dropped from the organization's name, making it simply the United Nations Children's Fund, or popularly known as \"UNICEF\".\nUNICEF relies on contributions from governments and private donors, UNICEF's total income for 2008 was US$3,372,540,239. Governments contribute two-thirds of the organization's resources. Private groups and some six million individuals contribute the rest through national committees. It is estimated that 92 per cent of UNICEF revenue is distributed to programme services. UNICEF's programmes emphasize developing community-level services to promote the health and well-being of children. UNICEF was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1965 and the Prince of Asturias Award of Concord in 2006.\nMost of UNICEF's work is in the field, with staff in over 190 countries and territories. More than 200 country offices carry out UNICEF's mission through programmes developed with host governments.

        "mission": "YouthBuild is a non-profit organization which provides education, counseling and job skills to unemployed young American adults (between ages 16 and 24), generally high school dropouts. There are 273 YouthBuild programs in the United States, with a total capacity of about 10,000 students yearly, and there are similar programs underway in over 15 countries. The headquarters are in Somerville, Massachusetts.\nThe YouthBuild program has five components: construction, education, counseling, leadership, and graduate opportunity. Students spend every other week on a job site, learning the construction trade by building homes for their own communities. This creates housing for low-income people, and also gives the students marketable job skills. The alternate weeks are spent on education in the YouthBuild classroom, with the goal of attaining a GED or completing their high school diploma. Many YouthBuild students come directly from the streets or from difficult life situations, so counseling is available to help them deal with anger management, family responsibilities, and other adjustment / life direction issues. Leadership is taught explicitly in YouthBuild programs, based on the philosophy that young people are not a burden, but rather a resource to be tapped. This, combined with ensuring opportunity and placement for graduates, means that many YouthBuild graduates go on to college, work in the non-profit sector, serve on committees, or even run in local politics.\nFunding for YouthBuild previously came primarily from the Department of Housing and Urban Development, but has transitioned to the Department of Labor. Other funding sources for programs are widely varied, but include other government agencies, private foundations, corporations, and individual donors.\nFounded and directed by Dorothy Stoneman and John Bell [1], one of the main purposes of YouthBuild is to build affordable housing for low-income families. Since 1994, more than 19,000 homes have been built by 92,000 YouthBuild students.",

It is not a charitable contribution, and is considered to be a tax, or obligatory alms. The payment and disputes on zakat have played a major role in the history of Islam, notably during the Ridda wars.\nZakat is based on income and the value of all of one's possessions. It is customarily 2.5% of a Muslim's total savings and wealth above a minimum amount known as nisab, but Islamic scholars differ on how much nisab is and other aspects of zakat. The collected amount is paid first to zakat collectors, and then to poor Muslims, to new converts to Islam, to Islamic clergy, and others.\nToday, in most Muslim-majority countries, zakat contributions are voluntary, while in a handful (Libya, Malaysia, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, and Yemen), zakat is mandated and collected by the state.\nShias, unlike Sunnis, have traditionally regarded zakat as a private and voluntary decision, and they give zakat to Imam-sponsored rather than state-sponsored collectors.",
